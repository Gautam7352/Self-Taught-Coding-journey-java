Two pointer algorithm:
Where can we use it?
When given array is sorted we can use 2-pointer algorithm. 											We can use binary search and 2-pointer algorithm in a sorted array only
It is used to make codes efficient. time-space complexity

How to do it???
In a sorted array, with two variable indexing pointers perform desired operations until required condition is met.
