Singleton Pattern
Singleton pattern is mostly used in multi-threaded and database applications. It is used in logging, caching, thread pools, configuration settings etc.

Steps to implement a singleton pattern
* Private constructor to restrict instantiation of the class from other classes.
* Private static variable of the same class that is the only instance of the class.
* Public static method that returns the instance of the class, this is the global access point for outer world to get the instance of the singleton class.
