Encapsulation: 
-> Keep related code and fields together. 
-> It makes code accessible to rest of the code in restricted form.
-> It also makes code neater.
-> We can control how our variables are used
-> It helps to decouple components of a system. These decoupled components can be developed, tested and debugged independently and concurrently. 
And, any changes in a particular component do not have any effect on other components.

How to achieve encapsulation?
1. Declare the variables of a class as private
Provide public setter and getter methods that will be used to write and read these variables values.

Data hiding vs Encapsulation
They both are different things, Encapsulation is the desire to keep same things together. Data hiding is just the residual result of it.
