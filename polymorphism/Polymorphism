Polymorphism-more than one form:
Polymorphism: It allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations.
Two types:
1. Run time
	- It is also known as Dynamic binding, Late binding and overriding as well.
	- Overriding is a run-time polymorphism having same method with same parameters or signature, but associated in a class & its subclass.
	- Slower execution

2. Compile time
	- It is also known as Static binding, Early binding and overloading as well
	- Overloading is compile time polymorphism where more than one methods share the same name with different parameters or signature and different return type.
	- Faster execution
