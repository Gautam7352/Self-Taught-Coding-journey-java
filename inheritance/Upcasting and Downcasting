Upcasting and Downcasting in inheritance:

Suppose Animal class is a parent class and Cat is a child class

Upcasting
cat c = new Cat();
Animal a = c; //Upcasting, it's fine since Cat is also an Animal

Downcasting
Cat c = new Cat();
Animal a = c;
Cat c1 = (Cat) a; //explicit casting, works fine because "c" is actually of type cat
